In the context of a web application, the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) directory 
typically contains one or more CSS files that define the styles and layout of your web pages. 
These stylesheets are used to control the visual appearance of HTML elements on your website. 
Here's an example of what could be inside a CSS file, such as style.css:

In this CSS file:

Default browser styles are reset to ensure consistency across different browsers.
Global styles are applied to the entire website, such as setting the font family, background 
color, and text color.
Specific styles are defined for elements like the navbar (navbar class), dropdown menus 
(dropdown and dropdown-content classes), and other layout components.
Selectors like .container, .navbar, .dropdown, etc., are used to target HTML elements with 
specific classes for styling.
You can customize the CSS file according to your design preferences and the specific 
requirements of your web application. Ensure that the CSS file is linked to your 
HTML templates so that the styles are applied correctly to your web pages.

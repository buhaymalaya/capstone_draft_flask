What is [esc]?
It is a web application created by a Domestic Violence (DV) survivor who is an immigrant from the Philippines. 
Later on, she became a family advocate for those fleeing abuse after seeking refuge from a DV shelter.
The purpose of [esc] is to create a safe digital space for survivors and hold a community where
they can vent, share experiences, support each other, and disemminate critical information. Survivors are usually isolated
from any from of social support by their POH (person of harm) in order to perpetuate and continue the abuse.
In addition, [esc] has an Intake tool that helps expedite the process of connecting a survivor seeking
refuge to their respective DV shelters that are located outside of their danger zone. Typically,
an intake process involves a survivor calling one shelter at a time, sharing their personal information
such as demographics, relationship history, last DV incident, etc. that the advocate needs.
Due to the nature of the process, it is extremely time-consuming for both potential client and service provider.
Through this digital intake form that can be sent to multiple shelters at once, it would increase the chances of the client
to reach refuge at a much faster rate. It also supports advocates to focus more on the clients they
currently have at their respective shelters, if they do not have a separate call center.
This platform also benefits survivors who are non-verbal/hard-of-hearing.
Please note that this does not replace the phone screening as each safehouse/shelter has their own set of requirements
for acceptance. Video calls may also be an option for those who are unable to speak during
the final screening, depending on the shelter's capabilities.
